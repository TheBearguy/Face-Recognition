<h1>Gold Rate Prediction Model</h1>

<p>This repository contains a gold rate prediction model developed using carefully curated datasets sourced from Kaggle. The model leverages various Python libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, to ensure accurate and reliable predictions.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Utilizes gold rate datasets from Kaggle</li>
  <li>Implements the Random Forest Regressor algorithm for prediction</li>
  <li>Uses NumPy for numerical computations</li>
  <li>Leverages Pandas for data manipulation and analysis</li>
  <li>Makes use of scikit-learn for machine learning functionalities</li>
  <li>Visualizes data and results using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Clone the repository:</p>
